# this is a step by step file which - 
# produces the serial movie
# assumes the following:
#   1 - the computeEigenFaces.py has been run
#   2 - classification.py has been run

# A - Show some of the raw faces

# B - explain we use haar cascades to find faces

# C - after splitting randomly mix up into training and test set

# D - Show the mean face

# E - show some of the eigen-faces after PCA

# F - show the size of the eigenvalues (indicates set variance)

# G - show the plot of generalized reconstruction error as a means 
#     to determine the number of PCA components we need

# H - try somehow to show a clustering of faces along eigen axes

# I - take a few faces and draw them with more and fewer eigenfaces

# J - explain briefly the 3 classification methods

# J1 - we must show the new faces in terms of their PCA somehow ( show its the same)

# K - show the accuracy face and accuracy numbers ( for knn show nearest faces)

# L - repeat on more difficult ( non- representitive faces )
